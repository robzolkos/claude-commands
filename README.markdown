# Claude Code slash commands

This is a work in progress as I learn more about Claude Code and its capabilities. The goal is to create a set of slash commands that can be used to interact with Claude Code in a more efficient way.

- Thanks to [Kieran Klaassen](https://x.com/kieranklaassen) for the inspiration and the initial code snippets.

## Available Commands

- **issue** - Creates well-structured GitHub issues from feature descriptions
- **pr** - Automates PR creation with code formatting and test verification
- **quiz** - Generates interactive quizzes to reinforce learning from coding sessions
- **reflect** - Captures and saves key learnings from completed tasks
- **resolve** - Addresses unresolved PR comments with fixes and automated cleanup
- **review** - Provides expert Ruby on Rails code review with line-specific feedback
- **work** - Plans comprehensive implementation strategy for GitHub issues
